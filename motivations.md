# Some of my motivations to better my career
- I have worked full time jobs from the age of 17 until now. Each position was entry level work, very low paying and physically strenuous. I knew i was wasting my brain power by working mindless labor jobs.
    - I'd like to note that i have a great respect for laborers, but it is not the position for me. A mental challenge is a lot more fulfilling for me than a physical one.
- I have always had an interest in programming: In 7th grade i was in a pre-engineering class, where we had to learn a little bit of javascript. I remember finding it very fun learning new syntaxes and debugging was a very rewarding experience.
- After taking a few years off of school i found myself wanting more mental stimulation in my career. I knew that programming was a fun way to rack my brain, so it would only make sense to find a career in something that i enjoy.
